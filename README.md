# Blue Balls - Color Matching Game

A fun and challenging HTML5 canvas game where players must match the color of two moving balls on opposite sides of the screen. Test your color perception skills with increasing levels of visual distractions!

## Game Description

Two blue balls move around in separate boxes on opposite sides of the screen. The left ball (target) has a specific color shade, and your goal is to adjust the right ball to match it exactly using HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) sliders.

### Features

- **Dynamic Ball Movement**: Both balls bounce around their respective areas with realistic physics
- **HSL Color Controls**: Adjust Hue, Saturation, and Lightness independently for precise color matching
- **Real-time Feedback**: See your accuracy percentage and color difference in real-time
- **Visual Distractions**: Toggle various difficulty-increasing distractions:
  - Moving Background: Animated gradient backgrounds
  - Color Noise: Random colored rectangles
  - Flashing Lights: Pulsing overlay effects
  - Particles: Floating particle system
  - Rotating Patterns: Spinning geometric patterns
- **Score Tracking**: Track your best accuracy score across rounds
